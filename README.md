# AspOS
My second little OS project, don't wanna continue the first one. This one is based on the OSDev wiki, with a few little changes.
It's helped to get me started, it's quite fun. It only runs in 16-bit real mode, but perhaps that will change in the future.

I'd like to get it to run in long mode, with full 64-bit access.
